// We need routes`/api/users:

// to GET all users

// Get a single user by _id

// Post route to add a new user

// Put route to update a user by their _id

// Delete route to remove a user by _id

// We could possibly make a new route all together for this I will see how clean it looks
// `/api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId`

// POST route to add a new friend to the user's friend list

// Delete route to remove a friend from the friend list
